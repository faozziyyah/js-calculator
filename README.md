## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
```html
<h1>HTML layout of a calculator</h1>
 <button type="button" class="operator" value="-">-</button>

	  <button type="button" class="operator" value="*">&times;</button>

	  <button type="button" class="operator" value="/">&divide;</button>
	  
	  <button type="button" value="7">7</button>
	  <button type="button" value="8">8</button>
	  <button type="button" value="9">9</button>
```
```css
.calculator-keys {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
```js
const calculator = {
  displayValue: '0',
  firstOperand: null,
  waitingForSecondOperand: false,
  operator: null,
};

  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
```

### Continued development
- sin, cos, tan functionality

### Useful resources

- [CSS grid](https://freshman.tech/css-grid-calculator/) - This helped me with CSS grid. I really liked this pattern and it's explanatory.
- [Js calculator resources](https://freshman.tech/calculator/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand javascript calculator. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
